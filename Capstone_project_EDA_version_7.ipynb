        "Exploratory Data Analysis is a process of examining or understanding the data and extracting insights or main characteristics of the data.It is an analysis approach that identifies general patterns in the data. It is crucial to understand it in depth before you perform data analysis and run your data through an algorithm. You need to know the patterns in your data and determine which variables are important and which do not play a significant role in the output.For this project we are analyzing Airbnbâ€™s New York City(NYC) data of 2019 using python language.\n",

It's a means for hosts to make money while safeguarding their assets from possible harm.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques.
