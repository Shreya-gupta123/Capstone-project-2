Project Summary
Objective
Airbnb, founded in 2008, is a global online marketplace that has transformed the travel industry. With millions of listings worldwide, it offers travelers a diverse range of accommodation options, from shared rooms to entire homes. Airbnb's impact on hospitality is profound, offering a cost-effective and authentic alternative to traditional hotels.

The "Airbnb Booking Analysis" project focuses on exploring Airbnb New York City data from 2019. Through data cleaning and analysis, it aims to unveil insights into booking trends. By investigating relationships between variables like price, location, and neighborhood, the project intends to provide valuable information for hosts to optimize their strategies. Simultaneously, it offers insights for city officials and regulators keen on understanding Airbnb's impact on the local economy and housing market. Ultimately, this analysis seeks to empower stakeholders to make informed decisions in the dynamic Airbnb market of New York City.
