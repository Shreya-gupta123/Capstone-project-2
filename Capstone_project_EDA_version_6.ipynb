        "Airbnb, Inc., based in San Francisco, California, operates an online marketplace focused on short-term homestays and experiences. The company was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Nathan Blecharczyk, and Joe Gebbia.Airbnb is an internet platform that links homeowners intending to rent out their properties with travelers seeking lodging in that area. It presently spans 220 nations and more than 100,000 cities globally. It's a means for hosts to make money while safeguarding their assets from possible harm.\n",

NYC is not only the most famous city in the world but also top global destination for visitors drawn to its museums, entertainment, restaurants and commerce.For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors.\n",

        "Understanding the factors that influence Airbnb prices in New York City, or identifying patterns of all variables and our analysis provides useful information for travelers and hosts in the city and also provides some best insights for Airbnb business.This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by the marketing team, finance team and technical team of Airbnb."
